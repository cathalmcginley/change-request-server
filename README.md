# Change Request Server
## A utility for creating new Change Requests and viewing old ones

The clutter of Service Now Change Request tickets (CRs) makes it difficult to 
create new tickets. This utility is intended as the back-end to a utility set-up
so an Agile team can keep metadata in YAML format, and share it using a Get repository.

This server backend, running Flask on Python, will interact with an Angular frontend.
